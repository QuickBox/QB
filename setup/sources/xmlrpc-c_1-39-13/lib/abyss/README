This directory contains the Abyss HTTP server component of XML-RPC For C/C++
(Xmlrpc-c).

This was derived from the independently developed and distributed
Abyss web server package in 2001.  Since that time, work has stopped
on package except for a non-free derivative of it that the original
author has done.  He uses the Abyss name for that.

So this is now strictly a piece of Xmlrpc-c.  Some day, we should change
the name to avoid confusion with the old code on which it was based and
the current non-free version.

But for Xmlrpc-c, we don't want to enhance this much.  That would
duplicate the vast amount of work that has gone into other HTTP (web)
servers such as Apache.  If someone needs fancy HTTP service for
XML-RPC, he should use Apache.  One can use Apache with Xmlrpc-c
either by using an Apache request handler plugin or by using a CGI
script.  Abyss is just for very simple servers, where the complexity
of using (or even acquiring) Apache would not be warranted.


Everything besides what's in the src/ directory is just historical --
it comes from the original Abyss in 2001.
