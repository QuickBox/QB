XML-RPC Turbocharger (Experimental)
===================================

This a hacked copy of mod_gzip. In addition to the usual "gzip" encoding,
it also handles "deflate" encoding.

When used in conjuction with the xmlrpc-c client, this should reduce your
outbound XML-RPC network traffic by an amazing amount--compression ratios
of 10:1 and 30:1 are not unheard of. If you're clever, you should be able
to use this with just about any Apache-based XML-RPC server.

You can find the standard distribution of mod_gzip here:

  http://www.remotecommunications.com/apache/mod_gzip/

The hacked distribution is installed and used in exactly the same fashion
as the regular distribution. There's one extra logging directive available:

  %{mod_gzip_compression_format}n   Compression format chosen by client.

Go read the mod_gzip documentation; it should all make sense.

This code is highly experimental, and may do some strange things. You'll
probably need to screw around with mod_gzip for a while until you get
everything to work. Don't run this on your production web server, OK?

P.S. The Turbocharger appears to dump core in mod_gzip decides to serialize
a large response to disk. Do you see what I mean by "experimental" and
"don't run this on your production web server"? :-)
