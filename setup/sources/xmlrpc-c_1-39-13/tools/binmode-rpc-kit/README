The Binmode RPC Implementor's Kit was created as part the xmlrpc-c project.

  http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/

The following files are included:

  README                This file
  COPYING               A standard disclaimer, etc.
  binmode-rpc-rfc.txt   The current draft of the standard
  oct2bin               A Perl script for turning the notation used by
                        the standard into actual binary data.
  binmode-rpc2xml-rpc   A script which translates a Binmode RPC packet
                        back into XML. You can use this for dumping wire
                        messages. (It also catches the most obvious ways
                        to misimplement the standard, so try it on your
                        output data.)
  examples/             Examples and counter-examples from the standard in
                        machine-readable format.
