.SH NAME
xml-rpc-api2txt \- Print out a description of an XML-RPC API as text
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xml-rpc-api2txt
\fIserver-url\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
xml-rpc-api2txt queries an XML-RPC server using the XML-RPC
Instrospection API designed by Edd Dumbill.  It then prints the
results to standard output in a nicely formatted form, suitable for
sending via e-mail.
.PP
You can find a list of supported XML-RPC server libraries (and patches
for many others) at \fBhttp://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/hacks.php\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I server-url
The name of the server to query.  Try
\fBhttp://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/interop.cgi\fR.
.SH BUGS
xml-rpc-api2txt assumes that method descriptions are ASCII text, not
HTML as specified in the standard.  (In practice, both conventions are
often seen.)
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR xmlrpc-c (7),
.BR xml-rpc-api2cpp (1).
