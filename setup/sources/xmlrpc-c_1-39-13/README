This is the source code for XML-RPC for C/C++, called Xmlrpc-c for short.

XML-RPC for C/C++ is programming libraries and related tools to help you
write an XML-RPC server or client in C or C++.

Documentation for the package is at

  http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/doc

See the Xmlrpc-c website at:

  http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/


PREREQUISITES
-------------

To build a useful Xmlrpc-c client library, you'll need to have at
least one HTTP library.  Xmlrpc-c knows how to use W3C Libwww (Version
5.3.2 or newer), Curl, and Wininet.  The configurator gives you the
option of building libraries that use any or all of these, and
defaults to every one you appear to have installed.  If you don't
appear to have any installed, the configurator causes the build to
omit client facilities altogether.

Information about W3C Libwww, including how to get it are at
<http://www.w3.org/Library>.

For Curl, see <http://curl.haxx.se>.

Wininet comes with Windows, and isn't available for any other platform.

You also need an XML parser/builder library.  An old version of Expat
is included in the package and used by default, so there's no actual
prerequisite here.  But if you separately obtain Libxml2, you can
configure the build to use that instead.  There's no really pressing
reason to do that, though.

BUILDING, INSTALLING
--------------------

See the file doc/INSTALL.

In the simplest case, it's just a conventional

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

See the doc/ directory of the source tree for information about the
source code.  User documentation is on the web, as described above.
