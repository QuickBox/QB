The copyright owners of this package license the public to copy it
(and do other things with it which are controlled by copyright law)
under a few simple conditions.

Each source file describes the copyright license for that particular
file.  This file summarizes the licenses for your convenience.

All the code written specifically for Xmlrpc-c, which is most
of the code, and the aggregation, is licensed under the
XML-RPC FOR C/C++ license shown below.

Some of the code was written for another purpose and copied into
Xmlrpc-c.  Its copyright owners license the code under a different
license:

The Expat Licence applies to the contents of the directory lib/expat,
the ABYSS Web Server License applies to the contents of the directory
lib/abyss and parts of the file src/xmlrpc_abyss.c.

The Python 1.5.2 license applies to parts of the file
src/xmlrpc_base64.c.

And as for the tools/ directory, you'll have to examine the licenses
on your own.

These same licenses have been offered throughout Xmlrpc-c's history.
