Funding for the project that created the original Xmlrpc-c was
provided in part by the good folks at First Peer, Inc., producers of
P2P applications.

Eric Kidd developed the original Xmlrpc-c in 2000 and maintained it up
through June 2001.

Bryan Henderson took over as maintainer in October 2004.

Xmlrpc-c contains (and relies on for some server functions) a derivation
of the Abyss web server by Moez Mahfoudh.

Xmlrpc-c contains (and relies on) a derivation of the Expat XML
parser, written by James Clark.

The base64 code was derived from what Jack Jansen developed for Python.
