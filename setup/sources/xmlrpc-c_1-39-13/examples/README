This directory contains working examples of uses of XML-RPC-c.  There are
XML-RPC server programs and XML-RPC client programs that use the Xmlrpc-c
libraries.

The make file is a combination of an example of how to build programs that use
Xmlrpc-c libraries and something that actually does build the programs in this
directory.  As such, it isn't perfect for either of those purposes.  To build
the examples, you must first build the libraries (make dependencies will not
take care of that for you).  Do that by running a default 'make' in the top
level source directory.  Then you can issue a simple 'make' in this directory.

A default make in the root of the Xmlrpc-c source directory does not build
this directory, but a 'make all' does.


The simplest server program is 'xmlrpc_sample_add_server'.  This
implements a single XML-RPC method called 'sample.add'.  All it does is
add two numbers and return the sum.  You can run such a server like
this:

  $ ./xmlrpc_sample_add_server 8080

The server this runs is based on the Abyss HTTP server.  file.  The
argument tell it to listen on TCP Port 8080 for RPCs.  It puts log
information in /tmp, so be sure to look there.

A client program that goes along with this server is
'xmlrpc_sample_add_client'.  All this client does is make an XML-RPC
request to Port 8080 of 'localhost' to add the numbers 5 and 7 and
print the result on Standard Output.

You can run such a client like this:

  $ ./xmlrpc_sample_add_client
